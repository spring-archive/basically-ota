--  Bota 1.8

---BOTA 1.7 (Beta 10.2)
- increased waterline by 10 
- added energystorage=1050 and metalstorage=1050 parameters to arm and core commander fbi files
- (as default values were too high).TODO: add Dynamic Collision Volume gadget from XTA and edit its config file

---BOTA 1.7 (Beta 10.1)
- got the mod working with newest spring version thanks to Beherith: builddistances of less than
  128 have now been changed to 128 for commander, T2 farc, constructors, and mine layer.
  (as Spring core clamping of build distance to 128 at minimum has been removed in the newest version)

---BOTA 1.7 (Beta 10)
- actually got the mod working with spring version 0.82 thanks to Tobi and BrainDamage helping

- Hover, Sea and Vehicle scouts now share the same laser. ARM and CORE lasers are slightly different.
  Was in beta 9 but forgot to add in the changelog :(

- replaced CORE T1 Aircraft lab model with Mr. D's remake

- added Licho's Unit E-stall Disable gadget and modified for BOTA
  (this is the one that deactivates units when a player doesn't have energy for their upkeep)

---BOTA 1.6 (fix 8)---

This mod is a modification of the OTA mod for spring.

It was created as an improved OTA mod that addresses the problems caused by the move to Spring.
While it does keep the same core gameplay of OTA, it is not an attempt to perfectly recreate OTA.
Stats for many units have been changed either for balance or gameplay reasons.

it includes the evolva models along with other models and scripts salvaged from other mods.

To install drop the BOTA_16b4.sd7 file into the mods directory

Changes from BOTA 1.6 (fix 7)
*Cool Stuff*
-Added LUA Functionality
-Added ICEUI as default UI
-Added Unit halos Widget
-Added Adv. Player List Widget
-Added Custom Formations Widget
-Added MetalMaker Widget
-Added Healthbars Widget
-Added Unit AoE Widget

*Balance*
---(Naval Fixes)---
-T1 Shipyards are now reduced in Cost and HP
-Scoutships no longer fire their missiles at other ground units
-Scoutships are also reduced in HP (They REALLY needed this.)
-Destroyers are reduced in cost
---(Ground Units)---
-Scout Vehicles (and Flea) now have mini radar
-Arm Spider now has increased firing range (15%)
-Arm Spider is now buildable from both the Adv.Vehicle Plant(original) and The Adv.Kbot Lab
     (This is a radical change, please give me feedback after a few playthroughs.)
-Arm Fido has been nerfed; Reduced Armor by 10%, Reduced Rate of Fire by 25%
-Fido speed has been increased by 15% however.
-Core Gator has had a 5% armor reduction, along with a 10% general reduction in mobility, and a 5% reduction in range.
---(Misc.)---
-Radar Towers now have an increased LOS (by 33%)
-Kbot labs(for both sides) are now the cheapest factories. Start spamming those bots!

*General Fixes*
-Unit min/max water depths have been increased. A lot more maps should be playable in BOTA now. Including Barracuda Bay.
-That annoying beep has been removed.(Those who've experienced it know what I'm talking about)

***The COB Errors have not been fixed yet. I need an experienced animation scripter to fix these. Until then, the ICEui will actually hide the COB flood (more or less sweeping the problem under a rug). For a more perminant solution, I need someone to rescript Mr.D's units so they stop spamming COB errors.
